### Introduction

Welcome to my personal Github account! This is the account I use to publish the code for some [V0LT](https://v0lttech.com) programs. This README is a quick reference for anyone new to V0LT who stumbles across this account! You can learn more about what I do at the official website.


### What is V0LT

V0LT is the online platform that I run for creating, distributing, and promoting freedom respecting, open source, ethical digital content. I personally create DRM free and freely licensed software, pictures, audio, 3D models, tutorials, and more. If you'd like to check out more of what V0LT has to offer, check it out at <https://v0lttech.com>


### Where can I contact you?

You can find my contact information at <https://v0lttech.com/contact.php>, including my PGP keys and Matrix contact information. However, if you'd like to just contact me directly over email, you can do so at <cvieira@v0lttech.com>


### What kinds of software do you write?

Honestly, a little bit of everything. Usually my inspiration for a particular project comes from a need that I have that can't be resolved with existing software.


### Can I find the source code for all V0LT software here on Github?

While a good portion of V0LT source code can be found on Github, there are a few programs that aren't hosted here. Since Github is run by Microsoft, and it requires non-free JavaScript to function, my main place for hosting source code is on the V0LT website itself. Think of GitHub like a mirror of the code up the V0LT website. The code here might be more up to date, but the source code for all of the official releases are accessible only using the V0LT website.


### Do you program professionally?

I do not. I'm currently studying to go into the cyber security and computer science fields, and V0LT is a side project that I'm extremely invested in. I don't program professionally, and the only time I make anything off of it is when people who enjoy my work [contribute financially](https://v0lttech.com/donate.php) to my website. While these donations are greatly appreciated, they don't even cover a fraction of the losses I incur running V0LT. When it comes to V0LT, I do what I do for the ethical reasons, not the financial gain.
