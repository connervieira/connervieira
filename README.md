### Introduction

Welcome to my personal GitHub account! This is the account I use to host the code for some [V0LT](https://v0lttech.com) programs. This README is a quick reference for anyone new to V0LT who stumbles across this account! You can learn more about what I do at the official website.


### Where can I contact you?

You can find my contact information at <https://v0lttech.com/contact.php>.

### What kinds of projects do you work on?

I do a little bit of everything in the field of technology. I have experience with software development, IT hardware/administration, automotive electronics, networking, and much more!

### What kinds of software do you write?

Generally speaking, I write web-based services in PHP, and local programs in Python, although I also have experience with C++ and Godot as well. Usually my inspiration for a particular project comes from a need that I have that can't be resolved with existing libre/open source software.

### Do you do commissioned/freelance work?

Absolutely! If you're an individual or business looking to use V0LT software to solve a unique problem, don't hesitate to get in contact using the information listed above.
