### Introduction

Welcome to my personal Github account! This is the account I use to publish the code for some [V0LT](https://v0lttech.com) programs. This README is a quick reference for anyone new to V0LT who stumbles across this account!


### What is V0LT

V0LT is the online platform that I run for creating, distributing, and promoting freedom respecting, open source, ethical digital content. I personally create DRM free and freely licensed software, pictures, audio, 3D models, tutorials, and more. If you'd like to check out more of what V0LT has to offer, check it out at <https://v0lttech.com>


### Where can I contact you?

You can find my contact information at <https://v0lttech.com/contact.php>, including my PGP keys. However, if you'd like to just contact me directly over email, you can do so at <cvieira@v0lttech.com>


### Can I find the source code for all V0LT software here on Github?

While a good portion of V0LT source code can be found on Github, there are a few programs that aren't hosted here. Since Github is run by Microsoft, and it requires non-free JavaScript to function, my main place for hosting source code is on the V0LT website itself.
